# 2023-SE-06_Lab_Task_07_DIP-

Prompt:

Write a Python program using NumPy, OpenCV, and Matplotlib, fully compatible with Google Colab, to demonstrate Frequency Domain Filtering on a grayscale image.
The program should perform the following tasks:
Allow the user to upload a grayscale image safely in Colab.
Display the original image.
Implement Low-Pass Filters (LPF): Ideal, Butterworth, Gaussian.
Implement High-Pass Filters (HPF) corresponding to each LPF type.
Apply all filters in the frequency domain using FFT and obtain filtered images using Inverse FFT.
Include a spatial domain Gaussian blur as a comparison.
Display all filtered results together in a clear, well-organized layout (LPF, HPF, Spatial Blur).
Provide a brief analysis explaining:
Effects of LPF vs HPF
Differences between Ideal, Butterworth, Gaussian filters
Comparison with spatial filtering
Ensure the code is well-commented, error-free, and lab-ready, with proper handling of data types and images in Colab.
